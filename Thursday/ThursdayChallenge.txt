Thursday Challenge
Using the ChallengeHeader.txt file from the Thursday Github folder, solve the following two challenges.

1) If you were to reply to this email, what email address would it actually go to?

2) It seems there's a hidden "message" somewhere..."ID"on't know how to decode it...do you?

Find the answers to both and bring proof to Matt in the meeting room again. Good Luck!
